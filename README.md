# CSS flex-box Layout Module

Before the Flexbox Layout module, ther was four layout modes:
  - Block, for sections in a webpage
  - Inline, for text
  - Table, for 2-dimensional table data
  - Positioned, for explicit position of an element

The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.
